# The Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC)

In this study we determine the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC), checking infection surveillance and control programs have reduced the rates of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection in US hospitals.

## Description
In this project I used: 
- ggplot2
- Plotly
- Use data plot-pipeline and the pipeline operator to make a histogram
- Shiny app 
    - Checkboxes indicating for which variables density plots should be produced
    - A slider changing the bandwidth parameter in the density estimation (‘bw’ parameter)

## Dataset
The SENIC Data Set
These data were obtained as part of the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC) to determine whether infection surveillance and control programs have reduced the rates of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection in US hospitals. This data set consists of a random sample of n=113 hospitals selected from the original N=338 hospitals surveyed. Each hospital is given an ID number, and is measured on 11 other variables.
